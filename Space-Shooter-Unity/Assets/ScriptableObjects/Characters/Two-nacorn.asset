  bio: "A deep-space warrior forged from tuna and unicorn DNA, galloping through
    the galaxy with two shimmering horns and the scent of sea brine. With a can of
    tuna skewered on one horn and laser blasts fueled by fishy fury, he battles for
    glory\u2014and the right to be gloriously weird."
